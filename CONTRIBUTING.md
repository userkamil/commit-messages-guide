# Contributing

First of all, thanks for the taking time to contribute and help people!

This document contains a set of guidelines for contributing to the repository. These guidelines are intended to provide a clear and concise to help you to know where help is needed and how you can contribute to improve the guide.

## Where can I help?

There are several ways to contribute. A contribution could happen both in the form of changes to the repository itself or through pull request reviews. Any kind of help would be appreciated.

In special, I'd like to highlight and bring attention to help in the form of:

- Fix of inconsistencies across languages
- Grammar and spelling corrections
- Improvement of source referencing (images, references, etc.)
- Incorrect, inconsistent or incomplete information fixes
- Pull request reviews
- Translation to other languages

## Principles

- **Consistency across languages over 100% correct grammar/spelling**: It's better to have some grammar and spelling errors than having outdated or specialized content for a single language. Use Google Translate or similar tools when needed.
- **Best practices in this guide should aim to help, not to set rule-following blindly standards**: It's intended to provide resourceful guidelines to help people communicate in a better, concise and clear way. It's a mean to an end, not the end itself.
- **One size does not fit all**: A project, team or company standards and agreements may override common practices. People may not agree 100% with all practices and it's ok. These things should not led to add or remove a guideline. Helping people should.
- **Native speakers are owners, but two heads are better than one**: Pull request authors do the best they can, but this doesn't replaces a good review by another native speaker.

Feel free to propose improvements if you have.

## Guidelines

Try to follow these guidelines when contributing. They're not rules and I'll not strictly enforce them, although I may ask you to adapt your contribution according to it.

Feel free to propose changes to the guidelines and use your best judgment.

### General guidelines

- You may fork the project to make changes to the repository. See [this Github guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) explaining how to do it.
- Use English for commit messages, issues and pull requests (both description and discussions).
- Use the [best practices](https://github.com/RomuloOliveira/commit-messages-guide#good-practices) described in the guide.
- Add `[PROPOSAL]` prefix to PR title when doing additions other than translations or corrections (e.g., [#31](https://github.com/RomuloOliveira/commit-messages-guide/pull/31))
- Github editor usually suggests a commit message like "Update file", add a description of your change in the commit body or change the title.
    - A good example: [7747659](https://github.com/RomuloOliveira/commit-messages-guide/commit/7747659824b83f6d07589daa66a67ee29fa60ddb)

It worth noting again that the best practices described in this guide are _guidelines_ and not rules. I won't refuse your contribution nor nitpick your commit messages if you're not following them strictly. It aims to help.

### New translation checklist

- Make sure you're working in the most updated branch. Rebase your code and fix conflicts when needed.
- Make sure you've updated the [Available languages section](https://github.com/RomuloOliveira/commit-messages-guide#available-languages) section in (and only in) README.md.
- Make sure you haven't included `Available languages` section in your translation (See [#31](https://github.com/RomuloOliveira/commit-messages-guide/pull/31)).

### Pull Request review process

Preferably, there should be at least 1 review from a native speaker. All pull requests will stay open for a few days waiting for a review help. Translations that didn't had a thorough review by a native speakers should be merged in a couple days, though.

All discussions should be resolved before a merge. Only [code owners](https://github.com/RomuloOliveira/commit-messages-guide/blob/master/CODEOWNERS) can do a merge. Native speakers have the authority to request changes in any pull request.

Everything that applies to a native speaker also applies to a fluent writer.

## Author notes

_by @RomuloOliveira_

I'm a Brazilian Portuguese native speaker still working on my English. I'll try to review all translations using Google Translate but a native speaker review is way more valuable.

I'll open pull requests for significant changes and proposals, but I may commit directly to the master branch for minor fixes or changes that do not affect translations' content.

Opinions and contents are my own and don't necessarily represent those of my current or former employers.

## Thanks

Helping people is priceless and I thank every and each of you that contributed to this guide.
